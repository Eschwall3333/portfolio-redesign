        <h2>About Emory Schwall</h2>
        <p>I'm a man of many many interests and tastes. For starters, I've always been madly in love with music, electronic music in particular. Ever since I saw a music video for one of Daft Punk's first tracks when I was four years old, I've been hooked. Since then I've not only been obsessed with listening to music but creating and studying it as well.</p>
        <p>When I was ten years old, I begged my parents for a guitar which is where I started learning how to play jazz. Not to long after that I got pretty bored and wanted desperately to learn how to build a guitar. A few electronics lessons from my father and tons of frustrating moments later, I built my first "franken guitar" which I still have and use to this day. My love for building guitars though soon spiraled out of control into severl different avenues like synthesizers, motorcycles, cars, audio gear, and computers.</p>
        <p>For the past 10 years I've been building computers, synthesizers and other electronic gadgets either from salvaged parts or specific store bought parts.  As a result of this hobby turned lifestyle, programming was very soon to follow in my repertoire of knowledge.  I've been programming for the better part of 4 years now, mostly tinkering, but it wasn't until 2019 that I decided programming and Web development was the industry I was going to choose to build my career.  I decided it was high time to further my education so I enrolled in the Georgia Institute of Technology Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.  The 6 month program taught me more than I could've ever imagined and certified me as a MERN and MEAN stack web developer.  Now I'm combining that knowledge with my several years of self taught skills to push my career goals in this field further and further. </p>
